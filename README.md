This project aims to implement a client that can send messages to a server using TCP.

The source code can be found on the Networking with Python: Socket Programming for Communication course from the Raspberry Pi Foundation on FutureLearn.

#### Checklist

[] Client source code
[] Server source code
[] Step by step
[] Add UDP variant
[] Package drop simulation

#### Testing

1. Open a terminal window and cd into the repo then run:
`python3 server.py`

2. With the server running, open another terminal window and run:
`python3 client.py`

3. Be amazed of how little this code does
